 CODEBOOK FOR THE MEANS OF THE FINAL TRANSFORMED DATA FOR THE GETTNG AND CLEANING DATA COURSE PROJECT
 ====================================================================================================
 
 This dataset contains 180 observations which are means of the means and standard devialtions of the base variables in the X_train and X_test datasets. 
 The means are calculated over each variable for each activity and each subject.
